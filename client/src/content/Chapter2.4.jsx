        <Topic>JavaScript Data Types</Topic>
        <Description>
          A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a
          string or a number.
        </Description>
        <Description>
          There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we‚Äôll cover them
          in general and in the next chapters we‚Äôll talk about each of them in
          detail.
        </Description>
        <Description>
          We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one
          moment be a string and then store a number:
        </Description>
        <Code
          code={`// no error
let message = "hello";
message = 123456;`}
        />
        <Description>
          Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are
          called ‚Äúdynamically typed‚Äù, meaning that there exist data types, but
          variables are not bound to any of them.
        </Description>
        <Title>Number</Title>
        <Code
          code={`let n = 123;
n = 12.345;`}
        />
        <Description>
          The <i>number</i> type represents both integer and floating point
          numbers.
        </Description>
        <Description>
          There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication{" "}
          <Highlight>*</Highlight>, division
          <Highlight>/</Highlight>, addition <Highlight>+</Highlight>,
          subtraction <Highlight>-</Highlight>, and so on.
        </Description>
        <Description>
          Besides regular numbers, there are so-called ‚Äúspecial numeric values‚Äù
          which also belong to this data type: <Highlight>Infinity</Highlight>,
          <Highlight>-Infinity</Highlight> and <Highlight>NaN</Highlight>.
        </Description>
        <ul className="mt-8">
          <li>
            <Highlight>Infinity</Highlight> represents the mathematical Infinity
            ‚àû. It is a special value that‚Äôs greater than any number. We can get
            it as a result of division by zero:
          </li>

          <Description>
            We can get it as a result of division by zero:
          </Description>

          <Code code={`alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity`} />

          <Description>Or just reference it directly:</Description>
          <Code code={`alert( Infinity ); // Infinity`} />

          <li>
            <Highlight>NaN</Highlight> represents a computational error. It is a
            result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for
            instance:
          </li>

          <Code
            code={`alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous`}
          />

          <li>
            <Highlight>NaN</Highlight> is sticky. Any further mathematical
            operation on <Highlight>NaN</Highlight> returns{" "}
            <Highlight>NaN</Highlight>:
          </li>

          <Code
            code={`alert( NaN + 1 ); // NaN
alert( 3 * NaN ); // NaN
alert( "not a number" / 2 - 1 ); // NaN`}
          />

          <Description>
            So, if there‚Äôs a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression, it
            propagates to the whole result (there‚Äôs only one exception to that:
            NaN ** 0 is 1).

          <Description>
            Doing maths is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù in JavaScript. We can do anything: divide by
            zero, treat non-numeric strings as numbers, etc.
          </Description>

          <Description>
            The script will never stop with a fatal error (‚Äúdie‚Äù). At worst,
            we‚Äôll get <Highlight>NaN</Highlight> as the result.
          </Description>

          <Description>
            Special numeric values formally belong to the ‚Äúnumber‚Äù type. Of
            course they are not numbers in the common sense of this word.
          </Description>

          <Description>
            We‚Äôll see more about working with numbers in the chapter Numbers.
          </Description>
        </div>

        <Title>BigInt</Title>
        <Description>
          In JavaScript, the ‚Äúnumber‚Äù type cannot safely represent integer
          values larger than (253-1) (that‚Äôs 9007199254740991), or less than
          -(253-1) for negatives.
        </Description>
        <Description>
          To be really precise, the ‚Äúnumber‚Äù type can store larger integers (up
          to 1.7976931348623157 * 10308), but outside of the safe integer range
          ¬±(253-1) there‚Äôll be a precision error, because not all digits fit
          into the fixed 64-bit storage. So an ‚Äúapproximate‚Äù value may be
          stored.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          For example, these two numbers (right above the safe range) are the
          same:
        </Description>

        <Code
          code={`console.log(9007199254740991 + 1); // 9007199254740992
console.log(9007199254740991 + 2); // 9007199254740992`}
        />

        <Description>
          So to say, all odd integers greater than (253-1) can‚Äôt be stored at
          all in the ‚Äúnumber‚Äù type.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          For most purposes ¬±(253-1) range is quite enough, but sometimes we
          need the entire range of really big integers, e.g. for cryptography or
          microsecond-precision timestamps.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers
          of arbitrary length.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:
        </Description>

        <Code
          code={`// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;`}
        />

        <Description>
          As BigInt numbers are rarely needed, we don‚Äôt cover them here, but
          devoted them a separate chapter BigInt. Read it when you need such big
          numbers.
        </Description>

        <Title>String</Title>

        <Description>
          A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
        </Description>
        <Code
          code={`
    const str = "Hello";
    const str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
    const phrase = \`can embed another \${str}\`;
  `}
        />

        <Description>In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.</Description>
        <ul className="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-400 flex flex-col gap-3">
          <li className="list-decimal list-inside">
            Double quotes: <Highlight>"Hello"</Highlight>.
          </li>
          <li className="list-decimal list-inside">
            Single quotes: <Highlight>'Hello'</Highlight>.
          </li>
          <li className="list-decimal list-inside">
            Backticks: <Highlight>`Hello`</Highlight>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Description>
          Double and single quotes are ‚Äúsimple‚Äù quotes. There‚Äôs practically no
          difference between them in JavaScript.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          Backticks are ‚Äúextended functionality‚Äù quotes. They allow us to embed
          variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in{" "}
          <Highlight>{"${...}"}</Highlight>, for example:
        </Description>

        <Code
          code={`
    let name = "John";

    // embed a variable
    alert(\`Hello, \${name}!\`); // Hello, John!

    // embed an expression
    alert(\`the result is \${1 + 2}\`); // the result is 3
  `}
        />

        <Description>
          The expression inside <Highlight>{"${...}"}</Highlight> is evaluated
          and the result becomes a part of the string. We can put anything in
          there: a variable like <Highlight>name</Highlight> or an arithmetical
          expression like <Highlight>1 + 2</Highlight> or something more
          complex.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          Please note that this can only be done in backticks. Other quotes
          don‚Äôt have this embedding functionality!
        </Description>

        <Code
          code={`alert( "the result is ${1 + 2}" ); // the result is ${
            1 + 2
          } (double quotes do nothing)`}
        />

        <Description>
          We‚Äôll cover strings more thoroughly in the chapter Strings.
        </Description>
        <div className="mt-5 mb-3 w-full p-5 bg-zinc-100 border border-zinc-300 dark:bg-zinc-800 dark:border-zinc-700 relative flex flex-col gap-3">

            üëâ There is no character type.
          </h3>

          <Description>
            In some languages, there is a special ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù type for a single
            character. For example, in the C language and in Java it is called
            ‚Äúchar‚Äù.
          </Description>

          <Description>
            In JavaScript, there is no such type. There‚Äôs only one type:{" "}
            <Highlight>string</Highlight>. A string may consist of zero
            characters (be empty), one character or many of them.
          </Description>
        </div>

        <Title>Boolean (logical type)</Title>

        <Description>
          The boolean type has only two values: <Highlight>true</Highlight> and{" "}
          <Highlight>false</Highlight>.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          This type is commonly used to store yes/no values:{" "}
          <Highlight>true</Highlight> means ‚Äúyes, correct‚Äù, and{" "}
          <Highlight>false</Highlight> means ‚Äúno, incorrect‚Äù.
        </Description>

        <Description>For Instance: </Description>

        <Code
          code={`let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")`}
        />

        <Description>
          We‚Äôll cover booleans more deeply in the chapter Logical operators.
        </Description>

        <Title>The ‚Äúnull‚Äù value</Title>

        <Description>
          The special <Highlight>null</Highlight> value does not belong to any
          of the types described above.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the{" "}
          <Highlight>null </Highlight>
          value:
        </Description>

        <Code code={`let age = null;`} />

        <Description>
          In JavaScript, null is not a ‚Äúreference to a non-existing object‚Äù or a
          ‚Äúnull pointer‚Äù like in some other languages.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          It‚Äôs just a special value which represents ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, ‚Äúempty‚Äù or
          ‚Äúvalue unknown‚Äù.
        </Description>

        <Description>The code above states that age is unknown.</Description>

        <Title>The ‚Äúundefined‚Äù value</Title>
        <Description>
          The special value <Highlight>undefined</Highlight> also stands apart.
          It makes a type of its own, just like <Highlight>null</Highlight>.
        </Description>
        <Description>
          The meaning of <Highlight>undefined</Highlight> is ‚Äúvalue is not
          assigned‚Äù.
        </Description>
        <Description>
          If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is
          <Highlight>undefined</Highlight>.:
        </Description>

        <Code
          code={`let age;

alert(age); // shows "undefined"`}
        />

        <Description>
          Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a
          variable:
        </Description>

        <Code
          code={`let age = 100;

// change the value to undefined
age = undefined;

alert(age); // "undefined"`}
        />

        <Highlight>
          ‚Ä¶But we don‚Äôt recommend doing that. Normally, one uses null to assign
          an ‚Äúempty‚Äù or ‚Äúunknown‚Äù value to a variable, while undefined is
          reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.
        </Highlight>

        <Title>Objects and Symbols</Title>

        <Description>
          The <Highlight>object</Highlight> type is special.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          All other types are called ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù because their values can
          contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).
          In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more
          complex entities.
          <br />
          <br />
          Being that important, objects deserve a special treatment. We‚Äôll deal
          with them later in the chapter Objects, after we learn more about
          primitives.
          <br />
          <br />
          The <Highlight>symbol</Highlight> type is used to create unique
          identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of
          completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.
        </Description>

        <Title>The typeof operator</Title>
        <Description>
          The <Highlight>typeof</Highlight> operator returns the type of the
          operand. It‚Äôs useful when we want to process values of different types
          differently or just want to do a quick check.
        </Description>

        <Description>
          A call to <Highlight>typeof x</Highlight> returns a string with the
          type name:
        </Description>

        <Code
          code={`typeof undefined // "undefined"

typeof 0 // "number"

typeof 10n // "bigint"

typeof true // "boolean"

typeof "foo" // "string"

typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"

typeof Math // "object"  (1)

typeof null // "object"  (2)

typeof alert // "function"  (3)`}
        />

        <Description>
          The last three lines may need additional explanation:
        </Description>

        <List

            `Math is a built-in object that provides mathematical operations. We will learn it in the chapter Numbers. Here, it serves just as an example of an object.`,

Definitely, null is not an object. It is a special value with a separate type of its own. The behavior of typeof is wrong here.`,
            `The result of typeof alert is "function", because alert is a function. We‚Äôll study functions in the next chapters where we‚Äôll also see that there‚Äôs no special ‚Äúfunction‚Äù type in JavaScript. Functions belong to the object type.

            üìã The typeof(x) syntax
          </h3>

          <Description>
            You may also come across another syntax: typeof(x). It‚Äôs the same as
            typeof x.
          </Description>

          <Description>
            To put it clear: typeof is an operator, not a function. The
            parentheses here aren‚Äôt a part of typeof. It‚Äôs the kind of
            parentheses used for mathematical grouping.
          </Description>

          <Description>
            Usually, such parentheses contain a mathematical expression, such as
            (2 + 2), but here they contain only one argument (x). Syntactically,
            they allow to avoid a space between the typeof operator and its
            argument, and some people like it.
          </Description>

          <Description>
            Some people prefer typeof(x), although the typeof x syntax is much
            more common.

            `string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there‚Äôs no separate single-character type.`,
            `boolean for true/false.`,
            `null for unknown values ‚Äì a standalone type that has a single value null.`,

        <Description>And one non-primitive data type:</Description>
        <List items={[`object for more complex data structures.`]} />
        <Description>
          The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a
